Analysis of Insurance Costs of U.S. Adults

In this project, I intend to analyze a sample of insurance costs of individuals across the United States, classified by age, sex, bmi, number of children, and inhabiting region. I would like to find out 1) the largest contributor to the cost of health insurance charges, 2) whether the region in which people inhabit affects the overall health insurance charges, and 3) as a 24-year old male with no children how much I would be charged for the insurance based on the given sample. 

My hypothesis is that 1) the largest contributor is bmi, because it is a good indicator of one's health condition, which plays a huge role in determining the insurance costs in general. 2) I do not think that there would be a meaningful difference in insurance charges depending on where people live, and 3) I would probably pay less than 10000 for insurance.
